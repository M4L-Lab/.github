## M4L Lab :wave:

Welcome to the Multiscale Modeling of Materials and Machine Learning Laboratory (M4L Lab), Dr. David Cereceda's research group at Villanova University. 
Our research focuses on creating and validating computational models to predict materials behavior across multiple spatial and temporal scales, with a special 
interest in studying material behavior under extreme environments and bio-inspired materials.
